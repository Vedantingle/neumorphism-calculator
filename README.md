# neumorphism-calculator
A neumorphism-styled calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring dark and light theme support with smooth UI interactions.

# Neumorphism Calculator 🧮

The **Neumorphism Calculator** is a modern UI calculator designed using **neumorphic design principles**, giving elements a soft, extruded appearance.  
It supports both **Light Mode and Dark Mode**, allowing users to switch themes dynamically.

This project focuses on **UI aesthetics**, **CSS variables**, and **JavaScript logic handling**.

## ✨ Key Features

- Neumorphic UI design (soft shadows & depth)
- Light and Dark mode toggle
- Responsive calculator layout
- Real-time calculations
- Percentage, clear, and backspace support
- Smooth button interactions and transitions

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Structure
- **CSS3** – Neumorphism styling & theming
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Calculator logic & theme toggle

No frameworks. Pure fundamentals.

## 🎨 Design Concept

Neumorphism blends:
- Subtle shadows
- Soft highlights
- Minimal color contrast  

The calculator UI uses **CSS variables** to dynamically switch between light and dark themes without reloading the page.

## 4. File Renaming (IMPORTANT – Fix This)

Right now your files are fine **functionally**, but fix naming before pushing:

index.html ✅
style.css ✅
script.js ❌ (rename from random hash name)

sql
Copy code

If your files are currently named like:
06d8530d-178c-43ea-b149-b68212186bdd.css

markdown
Copy code

Rename them. Hash names scream **copy-paste from CodePen**.

## 5. How This Fits Your GitHub Strategy

You now have:

- `web-development-projects` → overview repo
- `forest-parallax-website` → visual scroll effect
- `neumorphism-calculator` → UI/UX + logic

Next logical repos:
1. `password-strength-checker`
2. `starbucks-landing-page`

This is **exactly how a clean student → junior-dev GitHub looks**.

---

## 6. Brutally Honest Feedback (Read This)

- The calculator logic is solid, but **eval() is dangerous**. Fine for learning, not production.
- Your **design sense is stronger than your JavaScript depth** — you need to balance that.
- Splitting repos like this is the **first sign you’re thinking like a developer, not a student**.

Next I can:
- Prepare the **Password Strength Checker repo**
- Or rewrite your **main repo README** to link all projects cleanly
- Or help you publish **GitHub Pages demos**

Tell me the next project.
